Bastillion
======
Bastillion is a web-based SSH console that centrally manages administrative access to systems. Web-based administration is combined with management and distribution of user's public SSH keys. Key management and administration is based on profiles assigned to defined users.

Administrators can login using two-factor authentication with [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator). From there they can manage their public SSH keys or connect to their systems through a web-shell. Commands can be shared across shells to make patching easier and eliminate redundant command execution.

Bastillion layers TLS/SSL on top of SSH and acts as a bastion host for administration. Protocols are stacked (TLS/SSL + SSH) so infrastructure cannot be exposed through tunneling / port forwarding. More details can be found in the following whitepaper: [Implementing a Trusted Third-Party System for Secure Shell](https://www.bastillion.io/docs/using/whitepaper). Also, SSH key management is enabled by default to prevent unmanaged public keys and enforce best practices.

$ mysql -u root

MariaDB > CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS bastillion CHARACTER SET=utf8;
MariaDB > create user bastillion identified by 'password';
MariaDB > grant all privileges on bastillion.* to 'bastillion'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
MariaDB > flush privileges;

# Start Tomcat
$ systemctl start tomcat
```

**Sample httpd config:**

```
<Location /bastillion>
  ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion
  ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion
</Location>
<LocationMatch "/bastillion/admin/(terms.*)">
  ProxyPass ws://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion/admin/$1
  ProxyPassReverse ws://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion/admin/$1
</LocationMatch>
```

Build from Source
------
Install Maven 3 or greater

*apt-get install maven*
> http://maven.apache.org

Install Loophole MVC

> https://github.com/bastillion-io/lmvc

Export environment variables

    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
    export M2_HOME=/path/to/maven
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH

In the directory that contains the pom.xml run

	mvn package jetty:run

*Note: Doing a mvn clean will delete the H2 DB and wipe out all the data.*

Build to run with Mariadb
------

	mvn clean install -Pmariadb

Database management
------
The database schema is managed with Liquibase (https://www.liquibase.org/).

Resources are under src/main/resources/config/liquibase/

The **dbCreate** param conntrols whether or not the schema creation/update should be done when Bastillion starts.

Using Bastillion
------
Open browser to https://\<whatever ip\>:8443

Login with

	username:admin
	password:changeme

*Note: When using the AMI instance, the password is defaulted to the \<Instance ID\>. Also, the AMI uses port 443 as in https://\<Instance IP\>:443*

Managing SSH Keys
------
By default Bastillion will overwrite all values in the specified authorized_keys file for a system.  You can disable key management by editing BastillionConfig.properties file and use Bastillion only as a bastion host.  This file is located in the jetty/bastillion/WEB-INF/classes directory. (or the src/main/resources directory if building from source)

	#set to false to disable key management. If false, the Bastillion public key will be appended to the authorized_keys file (instead of it being overwritten completely).
	keyManagementEnabled=false

Also, the authorized_keys file is updated/refreshed periodically based on the relationships defined in the application.  If key management is enabled the refresh interval can be specified in the BastillionConfig.properties file.

	#authorized_keys refresh interval in minutes (no refresh for <=0)
	authKeysRefreshInterval=120

By default Bastillion will generated and distribute the SSH keys managed by administrators while having them download the generated private. This forces admins to use strong passphrases for keys that are set on systems.  The private key is only available for download once and is not stored on the application side.  To disable and allow administrators to set any public key edit the BastillionConfig.properties.

	#set to true to generate keys when added/managed by users and enforce strong passphrases set to false to allow users to set their own public key
	forceUserKeyGeneration=false

Supplying a Custom SSH Key Pair
------
Bastillion generates its own public/private SSH key upon initial startup for use when registering systems.  You can specify a custom SSH key pair in the BastillionConfig.properties file.

For example:

	#set to true to regenerate and import SSH keys  --set to true
	resetApplicationSSHKey=true

	#SSH Key Type 'dsa' or 'rsa'
	sshKeyType=rsa

	#private key  --set pvt key
	privateKey=/Users/kavanagh/.ssh/id_rsa

	#public key  --set pub key
	publicKey=/Users/kavanagh/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

	#default passphrase  --leave blank if passphrase is empty
	defaultSSHPassphrase=myPa$$w0rd

After startup and once the key has been registered it can then be removed from the system. The passphrase and the key paths will be removed from the configuration file.

Adjusting Database Settings
------
Database settings can be adjusted in the configuration properties.

    #Database user
    dbUser=bastillion
    #Database password
    dbPassword=p@$$w0rd!!
    #Database JDBC driver
    dbDriver=org.h2.Driver
    #Connection URL to the DB
    dbConnectionURL=jdbc:h2:keydb/bastillion;CIPHER=AES;

By default the datastore is set as embedded, but a remote H2 database can supported through adjusting the connection URL.

    #Connection URL to the DB
	dbConnectionURL=jdbc:h2:tcp://<host>:<port>/~/bastillion;CIPHER=AES;

External Authentication with JAAS
------
External Authentication can be enabled through the BastillionConfig.properties.

For example:

	#specify a external authentication module (ex: ldap-ol, ldap-ad).  Edit the jaas.conf to set connection details
	jaasModule=ldap-ol

Connection details need to be set in the jaas.conf file

    ldap-ol {
    	com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule SUFFICIENT
    	userProvider="ldap://hostname:389/ou=example,dc=bastillion,dc=com"
    	userFilter="(&(uid={USERNAME})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))"
    	authzIdentity="{cn}"
    	useSSL=false
    	debug=false;
    };


Administrators will be added as they are authenticated and profiles of systems may be assigned by full-privileged users.

User LDAP roles can be mapped to profiles defined in Bastillion through the use of the org.eclipse.jetty.jaas.spi.LdapLoginModule.

    ldap-ol-with-roles {
        //openldap auth with roles that can map to profiles
        org.eclipse.jetty.jaas.spi.LdapLoginModule required
        debug="false"
        useLdaps="false"
        contextFactory="com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory"
        hostname="<SERVER>"
        port="389"
        bindDn="<BIND-DN>"
        bindPassword="<BIND-DN PASSWORD>"
        authenticationMethod="simple"
        forceBindingLogin="true"
        userBaseDn="ou=users,dc=bastillion,dc=com"
        userRdnAttribute="uid"
        userIdAttribute="uid"
        userPasswordAttribute="userPassword"
        userObjectClass="inetOrgPerson"
        roleBaseDn="ou=groups,dc=bastillion,dc=com"
        roleNameAttribute="cn"
        roleMemberAttribute="member"
        roleObjectClass="groupOfNames";
    };

Users will be added/removed from defined profiles as they login and when the role name matches the profile name.

External Authentication via HTTP_HEADER
------
Bastillion supports authentication based on **REMOTE_USER** http header.

This allows more integrated authentication scenarios, using a reverse-proxy. The followinfg can - for example - be used:
- mod_cas, to authenticate against a CAS server
- Shibboleth SP, to authenticate against a SAML IdP

The external authentication mode is exclusive from all others authentication mode, and is activated through the **authenticationMode** parameter.

**Sample config with Shibboleth and httpd, in front of Tomcat:**

```
<Location /bastillion>
  # Tomcat listens on localhost:8080
  ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion
  ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion

  # Let Shibboleth SP manage authentication
  AuthType shibboleth
  ShibRequestSetting applicationId default
  ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
  ShibUseHeaders On
  Require shib-session
</Location>

<LocationMatch "/bastillion/admin/(terms.*)">
  # Proxy to ws:// because no TLS on tcp/8080
  ProxyPass ws://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion/admin/$1
  ProxyPassReverse ws://127.0.0.1:8080/bastillion/admin/$1
</LocationMatch>
```

Auditing
------
Auditing is disabled by default. Audit logs can be enabled through the **log4j2.xml** by uncommenting the **io.bastillion.manage.util.SystemAudit** and the **audit-appender** definitions.

> https://github.com/bastillion-io/Bastillion/blob/master/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml#L19-L22

Auditing through the application is only a proof of concept.  It can be enabled in the BastillionConfig.properties.

	#enable audit  --set to true to enable
	enableInternalAudit=true
